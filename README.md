# Calculator-OOP

This program is a modification of the earlier Simple Calculator Program that uses Object-Oriented Programming. 

Program Structure:
1. main_calculator.py: the primary point of admission into the program. The calculator GUI is launched after the appropriate classes are imported. Here is where the software is run. 
2. TkinterGUI.py: It includes the operations and calculations for the user-inputted numbers.
3. operations_calculator.py: Here, GUI and designs are handled.
